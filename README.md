# Beginner_Playground
This documents the beginning of my learning to code journey.

My goal originally was to play around in python with a good IDE, like PyCharm, since PyCharm makes it easy to play around with inputs and outputs very quickly, that way I could learn from my mistakes quickly as well.  A few attempts at basic problem solving across different data structures are included in this repo, and the list will liekly grow over time.  This repo may store more than just Python eventually, as JavaScript, C#, and a few others are languages I plan on practicing with for various purposes.
